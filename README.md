# Sinking Fund 
<br>

## Purpose<br> 
1. To practice programming, version control, project managment and problem solving.<br>
2. I wanted a personal sinking fund to track money allocation for each item in the fund. While there are plenty of these apps already available, when considering the the reasons listed above it made sense.
3. To have the foundations in place for working with web apps. 

## Features<br>
